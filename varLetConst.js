var a=4;
console.log(a);
const b=9;
console.log(b);
// difference between const and var : we cant print the const item in C++ it will give error because in c++ the code is compiled together but on the other hand we can print constant term in js because in js code is compiled line by line.

//redefinition
var c=5;
console.log(c);
var c=7;//no error
console.log(c);

var c=5;
console.log(c);
//const c=7;// error
console.log(c);
//this above redefinition isnt possible in C++ it will give error:(int a=8; cout<<a<<endl;
//int a=7; cout<<a<<endl;)-> this will give error but we change 2nd line like a=7; then print it there will be no error
